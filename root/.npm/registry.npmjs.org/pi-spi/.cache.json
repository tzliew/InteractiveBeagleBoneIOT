pi-spi\n\nSimple asyncronous node.js SPI library for Raspberry Pi (and likely other embedded Linux platforms that provide /dev/spidevN.N).\n\n\n## Example\n\n`npm install pi-spi`\n\n\n```\nvar SPI = require('pi-spi');\n\nvar spi = SPI.initialize(\"/dev/spidev0.0\"),\n    test = Buffer(\"Hello, World!\");\n\n// reads and writes simultaneously\nspi.transfer(test, test.length, function (e,d) {\n    if (e) console.error(e);\n    else console.log(\"Got \\\"\"+d.toString()+\"\\\" back.\");\n    \n    if (test.toString() === d.toString()) {\n        console.log(msg);\n    } else {\n        // NOTE: this will likely happen unless MISO is jumpered to MOSI\n        console.warn(msg);\n        process.exit(-2);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nProbably requires running node under `sudo` for SPI permissions, unless you've used [Wiring Pi's gpio utility](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/the-gpio-utility/) or otherwise adjusted device permissions.\n\n## API\n\n### spi = SPI.initialize(device)\n\n`device` will usually be \"/dev/spidev0.0\" or \"/dev/spidev0.0\". You will first need to enable the `spi-bcm2708` kernel module [e.g. these instructions](http://scruss.com/blog/2013/01/19/the-quite-rubbish-clock/#spi) or similar for your platform. As mentioned above, by default this device requires root permissions and so you'll either need to change this or run your script with according privilege.\n\n### spi.clockSpeed([speed])\n\nSets (or gets, if no argument provided) the clock speed in Hz. Defaults to `4e6`, i.e. 4MHz. The Pi only supports [powers of 2 speeds](https://projects.drogon.net/understanding-spi-on-the-raspberry-pi/) and faster speeds might get derated a bit.\n\n### spi.dataMode([mode])\n\nSets (or gets, if no argument provided) the \"data mode\" (clock phase and polarity) to e.g. `SPI.mode.CPHA | SPI.mode.CPOL`. Default is no flags.\n\n### spi.bitOrder([order])\n\nSets (or gets, if no argument provided) the bit ordering. Default is `SPI.order.MSB_FIRST` or you can set `SPI.order.LSB_FIRST`.\n\nNote that this is **bit** ordering, not *bytes* — byte ordering is up to your application.\n\n### spi.transfer(outbuffer, [incount,] cb)\n\nTransfers data for the longer of `outbuffer.length` or `incount` bytes. If successfully, the second parameter to your callback will be a buffer of length `incount` (which defaults to `outbuffer.length` if not provided).\n\n### spi.read(incount, cb)\n\nCollects incount bytes while writing as many `\\0` out.\n\n### spi.write(outbuffer, cb)\n\nWrites outbuffer, ignoring response bytes.\n\nNote that if there was an error opening the device, the `transfer`/`read`/`write` calls will fail each time called. I may [revise the initialize method](https://github.com/natevw/pi-spi/issues/2#issuecomment-27588982) so to allow you to handle the error better.\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright © 2013, Nathan Vander Wilt.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: \n\n1.
